# wyre-app
Invoice App using SQLite, Node, React

## Notes
1. I chose SQLite because much faster to configure and spin up than postgres or mysql. For this application do not need all that postgres or mysql has to offer.
2. I chose Node instead of Java or Python because to be more efficient with time.
3. I chose React instead of Angular for the same reason.

I thought about doing this in Ruby on Rails but I felt the technologies I chose are more closely related to the technologies being used at Wyre. However, I could have used RoR for similar reasons.
