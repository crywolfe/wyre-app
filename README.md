# wyre-app
Invoice App using SQLite, Node, React

## Notes
1. I chose SQLite because much faster to configure and spin up than postgres or mysql. For this application do not need all that postgres or mysql has to offer.
2. I chose Node instead of Java or Python to be more efficient with time.
3. I chose React instead of Angular for the same reason.

I thought about doing this in Ruby on Rails but I felt the technologies I chose are more closely related to the technologies being used at Wyre. However, I could have used RoR for similar reasons.

## STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
use `npm run dev` to spin up a local instance after pulling it down.

## TASKS:
1. Add Wyre API service call.
2. Create User object.
3. Populate User object with address data from Wyre get json.
4. Add a couple of unit tests.
5. Review Requirements doc.
6. Use next.js to deploy
7. Provide instructions for App use in README.
